                    This poem by Dom Marcos Barbosa “In praise of the Nativity” is from 1963 and appears
                    in his work “Poems of the Kingdom of God”. It is dedicated to Our Lady, on the occasion
                    of his birth into this world, a feast that the Church celebrates on September 8 —
                    nine months after the Immaculate Conception. (By the same author, and honoring the same
                    event, we have already published it here for your birthday.”)

                    Dom Marcos is from Cristina (MG), he was a Benedictine monk (hence the “dom”
                    that precedes its name), was directly involved in the translation
                    Brazilian Divine Office, became a member of the Brazilian Academy of
                    Letters in 1980 and passed away in 1997. His poetry was appreciated by names
                    such as Gustavo Corção and Cecília Meireles.
