                All three synoptic Gospels name Saint Philip and Saint Bartholomew as the fifth and sixth in 
                the group of twelve Apostles, and then nothing more is said to their respect. The latter [however] 
                is traditionally identified with Nathanael, who the Gospel of Saint John highlights at the end of 
                its first chapter (cf. 1, 45ff) and mentions at the beginning of the last one (cf. 21, 2ff) among 
                those who saw the Resurrected Lord in the Sea of ​​Tiberias. This is partly because, in",

                <em>John</em>
                1, it is Philip — with whom he is always associated in the synoptics — who leads him to
                Christ; and partly because Bartholomew is a patronymic, meaning “son of
                Tolmai” — “Natanael” being his first name. 
                <strong>The tradition of the Church</strong>
                accepts this identification, but
                <strong>, in the liturgy, he always uses the name Bartholomew</strong>

                Notwithstanding this, the [traditional] Roman [rite] Gospel for his feast
                is not that of his dialogue with Christ recorded in Saint John (cf. 
                <em>Jo</em>
                " 1, 44-55) [as in "

                "In those days Jesus retired to the mountain to pray, and spent the whole night in
                prayer to God. When it was day, he called his disciples and chose twelve
                among them, to whom he gave the name Apostles: Simon, to whom he gave the surname
                of Peter, Andrew, his brother, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas,
                James, son of Alphaeus, Simon, called the Zealot, Judas, brother of James, and Judas
                Iscariot, who was the traitor. Descending with them, he stopped on a plain. He was
                there a great number of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all over
                Judea, from Jerusalem, from the coast of Tire and Sidon, who had come to the
                hear, and to be healed of their diseases. Those who were vexed by the spirits
                unclean were also healthy."

                possessed, since, in his various apocryphal acts, Bartholomew performs many
                cures of both types. Many breviaries before Trent present a
                quite complete account of these stories, which are similar in general terms

                Christianity and helps the Apostle to convert many people, including a good
                number of pagan priests. Many impressive healings and miracles accompany
                this preaching, but they also arouse the envy of some pagan priests, who
                they do not convert and convince the king's brother to revolt against him. "
