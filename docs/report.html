            <p><strong> Introduction: </strong>This website tries to represent the 
                importance of Jesus's messages in our live. It was an inspiration from the cathequese
                group that I use to attend as a tutor. We do not see many options, on the
                internet, at least not in the English language or in good quality, of websites talking 
                about these topics, that create the curiosity to understand more about 
                the real purpose of the church and the Catholic faith. I have chosen 
                to use the webbed structure, that allows the use to look at what 
                they wish. The page has: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A few articles
                        reflecting on what it means to be a Christian.</li>
                    <li>An unique page
                        to show people that became saints based on their life style.</li>
                    <li>A single page talking about The Virgin Mary.</li>
                    <li>A page for quizzles testing people's knowledge about the christian faith.</li>
                    <li>A contact page, opening a section where people can get in touch.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Community from a local Church</li>
                    <li>Padre Paulo Ricardo's website</li>
                    <li>Lack of quality, and inspiring content in relation to Christianity</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Most contents is represented in text format, allowing any user/or screen reader to read it.</li>
                    <li>The images are followed by a lenged and/or description about the 
                        subject.
                    </li>
                    <li>It can be accessed by devices with different screen sizes.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Links allowing users to navigate through the website. The links 
                        have been create to be clicked by a mouse on desktops and touched 
                        on tablets and mobile.
                    </li>
                    <li>The page is responsive for at desktops, tables and mobiles.</li>
                    <li>At the contact page, users can leave their feedback to contribute.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when
                    creating your site, and describe how you did that:
                </strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How to create add hover animation to selectable things. I did not
                        know how to do it, so I went searching for it, and I found the solution
                        on W3 Schools. 
                    </li>
                    <li>How to toggle navbar without bootstrap. I was used to simply 
                        take the advantage of frameworks doing everything, and it was 
                        my first time building this effect purely on CSS. It was a good practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>How to develop an identity to the content. I have used the site Padre Paulo Ricardo 
                        as an example to my site's article, their articles has a really nice structure, giving it 
                        an aspect of 'biblical reading'. Not just article, but also, some aspects 
                        of their structure.                 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and 
                    why?
                </strong> The overall structure was very positive, this is my first
                    time creating a website on my own. I really enjoyed planning it,
                    the frameworks were really helpful to identify a north before start coding.</p>
                <p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might
                    you do things differently another time?
                </strong> I could include a way to apdate the represented data from time to time.
                    Also, add some videos on particular topics and more content.</p>
                <p><strong>What resources were used when creating your work?</strong></p>
